## Analysis of Robs data


### Instructions for use/installation:
- Data can be found on [https://gin.g-node.org/vdplasthijs/S1S2_mechanisms_data](https://gin.g-node.org/vdplasthijs/S1S2_mechanisms_data)
- Add data paths to `data_paths.json` file (using `username_hostname` as key). See `newuser_newcomputer` in that json file as an example template. 
- Install a conda environment with the necessary packages using `robs.yml`. 
- See `jupyter/thijs/Example data loading.ipynb` for a brief tutorial on how to load the data and use the main data structures. 

Then, everything should work (as far as tested). If not - let Thijs know (via Github issue/email)!!
